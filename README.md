# MemoInk - Personal Diary App

**MemoInk** is an Android mobile application, developed using **Visual Studio 2022** and **Xamarin Forms**. Created as part of a university project, it's built with **C#** and integrates with Firebase's **Realtime Database** for real-time data synchronization.

MemoInk functions as a Diary App, allowing users to create personalized **Topics** where they can add unlimited **Entries** enriched with text or images. Furthermore, MemoInk lets users grant permissions for others to access, edit, and contribute new Entries to a shared Topic. This turns the app into a collaborative space where friends and family can collectively build and cherish meaningful memories.

The app also offers privacy options, allowing users to choose between private or public profiles. This feature enables individuals to decide whether to share their memories with a selected group or with the entire world, providing a personalized and secure environment for capturing and sharing life’s beautiful moments.
