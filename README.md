# MemoInk - Personal Diary App

**MemoInk** is an Android mobile application, developed using **Visual Studio 2022** and **Xamarin Forms**. Created as part of a university project, it's built with **C#** and integrates with Firebase's **Realtime Database** for real-time data synchronization.

MemoInk functions as a Diary App, allowing users to create personalized **Topics** where they can add unlimited **Entries** enriched with text or images. Furthermore, MemoInk lets users grant permissions for others to access, edit, and contribute new Entries to a shared Topic. This turns the app into a collaborative space where friends and family can collectively build and cherish meaningful memories.

The app also offers privacy options, allowing users to choose between private or public profiles. This feature enables individuals to decide whether to share their memories with a selected group or with the entire world, providing a personalized and secure environment for capturing and sharing lifeâ€™s beautiful moments.

## **Complete Functionality Guide**

### Home Screen

- **Global Topics**: The home screen displays the 20 latest Topics under the 'Global Topics' section. These are topics available to the entire user base. However, access to each topic is permission-based. If you don't have the necessary permissions to view a topic, attempting to open it will result in a message indicating you cannot access it.

- **Shared Topics**: Below the 'Global Topics', you'll find the 'Shared Topics' section. These topics are ones that other users have shared with you by granting specific permissions. This allows for collaborative discussions and content sharing within a controlled environment.

### Creating a New Topic

1. To create a new topic, tap on the **plus symbol (+)** on the bottom navigation bar.
2. Enter your topic details, including the title and date.
3. In the 'User Permissions' section, select which users you wish to grant access to by checking the box next to their name. Use the **SELECT ALL USERS** button to grant access to all users quickly.
4. Save the topic by tapping the **SAVE** button, or cancel the process by tapping **CANCEL**.

### Adding Entries to a Topic

- When viewing a topic, such as the 'Gaming Topic', you can add new entries by tapping on **ADD ENTRY +**. Here, you can write content, share images, and document experiences related to the topic.

### Profile and Settings

- The 'Profile' screen allows you to view your personal information, including your username, country, and contact options like email and website.
- Users can visit each other's profiles to learn more about them and view the topics they have published.
- The 'Settings' screen provides a summary of your personal information and offers access to modify your account details and contact preferences.

### Searching for Users

- The app includes a feature to search for other users. This functionality lets you view the profiles of fellow users, see their published topics, and potentially engage with their content, depending on permissions.

### Permissions and Accessibility

- Permissions play a crucial role in the app. They determine what content you can view and interact with. If you try to access a topic without the required permissions, the app will notify you that access is not allowed.

### Additional Notes

- The app is designed with user collaboration and privacy in mind, creating a space where personal and shared experiences can be documented and discussed within a community setting or in private.
